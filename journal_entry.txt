Today, I went to the store and picked up some things I needed for dinner. I wish that things would open back up again
as covid has been hard. However, I got to go to yoga and that was needed and much enjoyed. I hope to integrate that
back into my routine again in the future. I am lonely some days but I remain hopeful that this will be over soon and
also that I will see my friends at some point. I also called my parents and it is always good to hear them and that
makes me happy to know they are well.
